These ideas probably wont happen, i just want to have them written down


Anomalies 
Like crystal chaos but smaller scale and less profitable, happen at least once a day 



Planetary conquest and building - This ended up being way more complex than i initially imagined it would be
Use a system similar to the new koth, 3 points per planet, holding 2 gives you control of the planet with 66% of the profit output, holding all 3 gives 100% of any output
Base income of 33m per point held per day. Every week held increases the profit per point by 1% - Losing control of 2 points resets the streak

Things that can be bought/upgraded to improve the output and maybe even give item as an output
Each upgrade tier allows more citizens to work there, increasing its output of resources / money? 
Citizens start to die if there isnt enough food / a point is held by another alliance

Power planet - Allows the other things to be purchased and work. Reactor must have uranium in the planet cargo to consume in order to power the other things.
Housing - Provides citizens to operate the buildings
Military Industry - Reduces shipyard build time?
Commercial Industry - Improves the planetary profit based on the amount of citizens in housing
Agriculture - People gotta eat 
Solar farm - reduces uranium use
Ice drill - Produces ice once an hour
Quarry - Produces gravel once an hour
Mine - Produces a random ore between configured amounts
